This is a simple node.js note taking app.

This app has 4 funtionalities, which are :
* adding a note
* removing a note/notes. 
* listing all the note/notes.
* reading particular note/notes. 

This app stores/fetches data to/from the file called "notes.json ".

This app was built to refresh the basics of node.js.

Thank you.
